# 42-so_long

This is the first graphic project at 42, a small 2D game. <br>

SoLong is an individual project at 42 that requires us to create a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites and some very basic gameplay elements using MinilibX, a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C, designed for students, suitable for X-beginners.
